                <h2>Questions and Their Answers</h2>

                <h4>What is this site?</h4>
                <p>I want to get better at writing and coding, so I thought it might make sense
                    to combine them. I am not yet sure how frequently I will add to this, although I have ideas for at least
                    a couple more essays. So maybe there will be others.
                </p>

                <h4>Are these really frequently asked?</h4>
                <p>Not yet, but if you ask them they will be.</p>

                <h4>Does this work on mobile?</h4>
                <p>It should! Let me know if not.</p>

                <h4>How can I get in touch with the author?</h4>
                <p>Emailing thispenstation@gmail.com.</p>
