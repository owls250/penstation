            <h3>Cicadas</h3>

            <p>They asked me if I remembered -- before they came. Dropping one by one. No, I didn’t, I said, 
                but of course I didn’t. How could I. So I turned the question on them -- do you?</p>
            <p>Maybe that was why my neighbors asked. Because they are not used to people as old as I am not 
                remembering. Because you’d remember, if your life had overlapped.</p>
            <p>The cicadas live apart from us. They do not give us diseases; we do not rely on them for food. 
                And yet when I see them I start to understand how insects could be a plague rather than another 
                seasonal star. Because the sidewalks I walk on are full of their corpses. Yes, insects are living 
                and breathing and dying around us all the time, but I am not usually confronted with such a 
                memento mori on my walk home. With the birds I can say a prayer to whatever Being. I cannot with the 
                cicadas. There are too many. But who am I to complain about that pain? They are the ones dying.</p>
            <p>It was strange to see the corpses before the insects. But soon after I saw the skins discarded on 
                the ground, like pennies or apple seeds. Once useful. I am caught by the forms, the contradiction 
                between black body, golden exoskeleton; the light catches their wings; the same form over and over 
                with slight variations. I take pictures of these. But I am not quite sure why I have the urge to 
                do so. And I am not sure who would want to see them.</p>
            <p>Now the sirens wail. Like snow, it impresses me that something so small can take over so much of my 
                world. And I worry about what they warn of. The optimist in me would like to think it’s not us.</p>
            <p>I was surprised, the first time one of them landed on me. I wasn't expecting that much resistance 
                to my attempt to brush them off. But also, suddenly, they were real. They were no longer the ones spoken 
                about in whispers by wise elder folk or the scientific anomaly whose enlarged pictures unfurled over 
                sidebars. It was like meeting a celebrity.</p>
            <p>Over the past several weeks I've developed a technique: find a thin stick of suitable length, offer it longwise above the insect. 
                Once they grab on gently and slowly bring the stick to the ground. Repeat until the cicada is upright 
                and able to walk away. But I do not know if it helps. I do know a story about someone walking along the 
                beach. They were throwing starfish that had washed up back into the ocean. Someone came up to them and 
                asked them why the person was throwing the starfish. They couldn’t save all of them. The person said 
                “but I saved that one. And that one. And that one.”</p>
            <p>The part that makes the cicadas an event seems to be that they come every 17 years. But I’m also thinking 
                about the fact that this is always happening -- in 2 and 3 and 15 years the cicadas will still be there. 
                They just won't be seen. But I think in 2 or 3 or 15 years I’ll see small holes in the ground or bugs 
                that almost sound like them or a picture in a book and I will remember when they were real. Or rather, 
                I’ll remember that they are growing right now. And I may even tell, almost warn, someone younger than me 
                about the cicadas they will one day try not to step on.</p>

            <h3>Ice Breaking</h3>
            <p>
                Somewhere, in the handbook of how to hold human meetings, it must suggest that ice breaking
                is an essential part of the process. Specifically, it must imply that ice breakers are necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because otherwise why would people have them? Or maybe that's just me because I 
                can never remember my favorite color or animal or what kind of salad begins with my first initial. 
                And somehow, even if I do, it doesn't seem any better than if I hadn't said anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first words are often the hardest. There is so much pressure riding on them because they 
                are everything that you know about me. Any words after are a diminishing fraction of everything. 
                And it is an impossible task to convey the entirety of one's being in a salad.
            </p>
            <p>
                So there are solutions. Instead of the first category, favorites, or the second category, occupation 
                (which could also be grade, what school you go to, what city you're from, or anything else that says
                something about what you do but perhaps little about who you are), there is a third option: what vegetable
                represents your soul? If you could fly to the moon, would you? Where would you go? Who would you be? Done 
                well, these questions speak to the how of you, if not the what. They convey your being in the thinking. However,
                this is not a perfect solution. These questions can demand too much introspection for the five seconds you have.
                And that can make your confidence leak when you need it most: when you meet me.
            </p>
            <p>
                As usual, perhaps the answer is to be more charitable. Maybe the ice breaker does not have to be
                extraordinary: it just has to be good enough. Maybe the people leading them are thinking about the next
                presentation; the next activity; the complexity of bringing together many people and hoping they all go
                in similar enough directions for the time they are together. I tend toward optimization, but I am learning
                to let go just enough for one moment. And that seems anathema to an ice breaker.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, a final question: What even is an ice breaker?
            </p>
