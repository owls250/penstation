        <h3>The first</h3>
        <p>
            Somewhere, in the handbook of how to hold human meetings, it must suggest that ice breaking
            is an essential part of the process. Specifically, it must imply that ice breakers are necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because otherwise why would people have them? Or maybe that's just me because I 
            can never remember my favorite color or animal or what kind of salad begins with my first initial. 
            And somehow, even if I do, it doesn't seem any better than if I hadn't said anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first words are often the hardest. There is so much pressure riding on them because they 
            are everything that you know about me. Any words after are a diminishing fraction of everything. 
            And it is an impossible task to convey the entirety of one's being in a salad.
        </p>
        <p>
            So there are solutions. Instead of the first category, favorites, or the second category, occupation 
            (which could also be grade, what school you go to, what city you're from, or anything else that says
            something about what you do but perhaps little about who you are), there is a third option: what vegetable
            represents your soul? If you could fly to the moon, would you? Where would you go? Who would you be? Done 
            well, these questions speak to the how of you, if not the what. They convey your being in the thinking. However,
            this is not a perfect solution. These questions can demand too much exploration for the five seconds you have.
            And they can make your confidence leak when you need it most: when you meet me.
        </p>
        <p>
            As usual, perhaps the answer is to be more charitable. Maybe the ice breaker does not have to be
            extraordinary: it just has to be good enough. Maybe the people leading them are thinking about the next
            presentation; the next activity; the complexity of bringing together many people and hoping they all go
            in similar enough directions for the time they are together. I tend toward optimization, but I am learning
            to let go just enough for one moment. And that seems anathema to an ice breaker.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I leave you with a final thought: What even is an ice breaker?
