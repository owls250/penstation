                Maybe what I really want to say is in the Mary Oliver poem <a href="https://apoemaday.tumblr.com/post/652534824201027584/in-blackwater-woods">In Blackwater Woods</a href>, 
                but I can't. So I'll talk about a dog instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have loved dogs in the stop-and-pet-them kind of way for as long as I can remember. Probably since I first met 
                my aunt's dogs, when they were bigger than I was. But it's never been able to be more than that.
            </p>

            <p>
                And then recently, it was. Someone important to me asked me to dog and housesit, so in the few weeks before I left I had to 
                make it work. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The first night I was restless. What if I forgot to feed her? What if she hurt herself when I was the only one there? And I 
                had been nipped at by a dog years ago, enough to be a little nervous. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I was told to greet the dog in the morning with food and then to read a book next to her. The idea was that she would 
                associate the food with me and then get used to me while we weren't doing anything difficult. I think this might be 
                my new strategy for meeting people too. Food and time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The dog trainer taught me how to work with the dog. So really she is also a dog trainer trainer. She uses a method called positive reinforcement. 
                Simplifying a lot, this means that when the dog does something you like you mark the behavior with "Yes!" 
                and then reward. Reward meaning food, usually. But enthusiasm is also a part of the method, and since I 
                tend to be fairly low energy, I had to practice. One of the first things the trainer said to me, as she 
                was using excited beeping to move the dog away from chicken bones in the grass, was if 
                you aren't embarassed, you're not doing it right. And I am working on bravery, so I try. Soon I am having 
                conversations with the dog in the street. It's an important skill, if not one I ever expected to learn.
            </p>

                She skid away when I tried to put the harness on, so we decided not to push it for a while. The dog has boundaries 
                we respect just as we have ones she does. And we have the luxury of the dog trainer spending a lot of time 
                coming over every time we go for a walk. After we do for a few times I no longer freeze so much at new 
                situations on the sidewalk. The dog starts looking at me like "hi, how are you doing?" or "where to now?" or, more likely, "why don't 
                you grow another couple of legs so we can go faster?" Eventually, when we are hanging out at home she starts 
                brushing up against me. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I tell her it's going to work out. She looks at me. It takes her a while to believe me. Or maybe that's me 
                that takes a while to believe her. It's a lot less pressure talking to her. And slowly I learned how to listen 
                to her. Loose wags. Legs splayed to the side she's lying down. And she let me put the harness on. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When I got the news I was waiting for I couldn't say it. I just talked around it and hoped the dog 
                understood. I wondered if she was waiting for the same person I was to walk around the corner or start 
                a pot of rice. And I couldn't remember how to be enthusiastic.
            </p>

            <p>
                I haven't told her yet.
