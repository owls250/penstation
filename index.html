                Hi! And welcome to Pen Station. At least... that's the working title. I guess we'll see if that changes. 
                Anyways, I'm glad you are here! This website is going to collect my short essays.

            <h3>Mulberries</h3>

            <p>
                I don’t remember when my dad first introduced me to mulberries. Maybe they were one of those 
                things he did by himself until I was old enough to join him. Or maybe they were always there 
                and I just didn’t notice.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first sign is dark stains on the sidewalk. Then you look up and see yes, this is the time and place. 
                I suppose one could write down the location of some of the mulberry trees so that year to year one would know where to go 
                instead of bumbling into them every spring. But that seems like it would be against the spirit of the ritual. Instead 
                I operate on vague memories and surprise. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Mulberries amaze me because they are a part of the city. For years I have been carefully coaxing seeds into vegetables. 
                I get as close as I can to doing it all myself, although even as I do I realize that getting there isn't possible. 
                There will always be seeds I didn't collect, plants that have to grow themselves, and tools I didn't make. I cannot 
                stand alone in a web. When I was younger I resisted the responsibility that went with being an older sibling even as the caring marked 
                me. I feared that I wouldn't remember to get him or that something would happen that I couldn't prevent. As we've grown older 
                we've grown closer in age. It has turned into a mutual taking care and then I have chosen to take care of others. It has become a part of me. 
                And yet I still struggle to water the plants enough. I forget, or I think the tomatoes should be watered in the morning, 
                or maybe it will rain. Then I see their parched bodies and remember it has been too long. And I feel so guilty for it. 
                So I appreciate food that grows without my intervention. The berries take care of themselves.

                The thing about picking is that mulberry trees grow tall. More often than not, you'll see the fallen fruit and 
                be unable to reach the branches they came from. Even if one year the tree is low enough, by the next year it may have graduated 
                to beyond human reach. This isn't just delayed gratification. This is knowing that you will never get what you want. The good thing is that, 
                at least in my neighborhood, there will always be another tree. But it can be difficult to choose another goal.

                At some point it may be tempting to pick up the lovely, full berries lying on the ground, but do not because surely 
                the ants have gotten there before you, even if you can't see them. There aren't many rules in life, but I recommend that one. 
                Although, if you were the one to knock it off you probably are fast enough. The other day my aunt asked if I had any 
                absolute principles. I wanted to say love, or compassion. Or to be myself. But sometimes loving one person means that you 
                have to ask someone who would hurt them to find another place. Sometimes compassion is unfair. It would be nice to have just one 
                thing and to then not have to think about any others, but 
            </p>

            <p>
                When I was far from home I was speaking with two other strangers. I was trying to describe where I was from in terms of lived 
                experience rather than the tourist one. And mulberries seemed like a good place to start. 
                I explained the way I usually do -- they look like blackberries but are not. I never know what to say next. They taste like mulberries. 
                The others didn't know either in the language we were speaking, but to my surprise they seemed to know in their own. Like colors, 
                I didn't know if we were thinking of the same thing, but they also were quiet and nice and somehow I associated all three and decided 
                we must be.
            </p>

                Of course, once you pick the mulberries, you can eat them. You may open the bag to discover that you crushed some of them 
                on the way home. This okay. We are all doing our best. If you are going to make something with them you may discover that 
                it is probably not worth the effort -- the stem seems somehow necessary to the structural integrity of very ripe berries. 
                Well, none of this is objectively worth it. It's only worth it because of the enjoyment you get. So if you are brave enough to 
                get here you could start by searching mulberry recipes, but I don't think I have. I made tartlets one year with a bit of sugar 
                and some lemon and cornstarch in a muffin-sized pie crust. And you can put them on pancakes. Or in pancakes. Or make jam. 
                Really, anything you can imagine. Although by the handful is also a perfectly acceptable method.

            <p>
                Recently I have started to run into mulberries everywhere -- reading about silk production, types of paper, and in a Babylonian 
                myth startlingly similar to Romeo and Juliette. According to the legend, mulberries are dark because the blood of Pyrmus falls on them. 
                Except some are white, even when fully ripe. Pyrmus and Thisbe had fallen in love by talking though a hole in the wall, which 
                I have to admire in a pandemic. I wonder if it was easier to be themselves if they didn't have to look each other in the eye.

                I still don't know how to tell what experiences are universal and which are unique. I have been working 
                on talking about my experience though: "I feel" and "I think" and trying to locate the source of how and why 
                I do. However, then it can come off as assuming that it is just me. Mulberries are not just me. But they are me.
